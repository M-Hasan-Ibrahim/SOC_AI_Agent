    "source_ip": "203.0.113.45",

    "destination_port": 443,
    "source_hostname": "mail.companny-secure.com",
    "destination_hostname": "johns-laptop.company.com",
    "alert_type": "Phishing",
    "severity": "High",
    "rules_triggered": ["Suspicious Sender Domain", "Malicious URL Detected"],
    "trigger_reason": "Suspicious sender domain and suspicious URL in email body. The email prompts for a password reset via a fake link (http://secure-companny-reset.com/login)."


**Step 1: Extract Email Indicators**
Suspicious elements:
*   Sender domain triggers suspicion (`mail.companny-secure.com`, note typo).
*   Suspicious URL in email body: `http://secure-companny-reset.com/login` (likely a fake link for password reset).

**Step 2: Check URLs and Attachments**
Scan the suspicious URL: `http://secure-companny-reset.com/login`. No attachments mentioned.

**Step 3: User Activity Check**
No specific user activity details provided in the alert. The recipient (associated with `johns-laptop.company.com`) is unknown if they interacted with the email or clicked the link.

**Step 4: Recommend Remediation**
1.  Notify the affected user immediately: John should change his password and any associated service credentials.
2.  Block the suspicious sender domain (`mail.companny-secure.com`).
3.  Blacklist the malicious URL found in Step 2 (once confirmed).

Response to alert:
 timestamp: 2025-07-15 09:15:00
source_ip: 10.1.1.12
destination_ip: 192.168.1.101
source_port: 45211
destination_port: 22
source_hostname: internal-pc01
destination_hostname: prod-ssh-server
alert_type: Brute Force SSH
severity: high
rules_triggered: ['ssh_brute_force', 'multiple_failed_logins']
trigger_reason: More than 50 failed SSH login attempts in 5 minutes

Okay, here is the response following your steps:

**Step 1: Review Alert Details**
*   The alert involves multiple failed login attempts targeting the account `prod-ssh-server` (destination hostname) at IP address `192.168.1.101`. The source IP of these attempts was `10.1.1.12`.

**Step 2: Check for Threat Intelligence**
*   I cannot access external threat intelligence databases like AbuseIPDB.

**Step 3: Search for Successful Logins**
*   There is no additional information available to check if the account `prod-ssh-server` had successful logins around or after this time. This step requires querying system logs beyond the provided alert details.

**Step 4: Recommend Remediation**
*   Based on the high severity and multiple rules triggered, a brute force attack attempt is confirmed against `prod-ssh-server`. Although we don't know if it was successful *yet*, standard response includes monitoring for persistence. However, given the intensity (50+ attempts in 5 mins), resetting the account password or SSH key as a precautionary measure is highly recommended. Also, consider blocking the source IP (`10.1.1.12`) to prevent further attempts if it's deemed malicious and not required access.

Response to alert:
 timestamp: 2025-07-15 09:15:00
source_ip: 10.1.1.12
destination_ip: 192.168.1.101
source_port: 45211
destination_port: 22
source_hostname: internal-pc01
destination_hostname: prod-ssh-server
alert_type: Brute Force SSH
severity: high
rules_triggered: ['ssh_brute_force', 'multiple_failed_logins']
trigger_reason: More than 50 failed SSH login attempts in 5 minutes

**Step 1: Review Alert Details**
Based on the alert, the **`internal-pc01`** (source hostname) at IP address **`10.1.1.12`**, using port **`45211`**, attempted a brute force attack against the SSH service running on **`prod-ssh-server`** (destination hostname) at IP **`192.168.1.101`** and destination port **`22`**.

**Step 2: Check for Threat Intelligence**
The instruction is to look up threat intelligence databases like AbuseIPDB.
*   The source IP **`10.1.1.12`** is an internal network address (starting with 10.x). It's unlikely this specific IP would be publicly listed in standard threat intelligence databases without further context or correlation across networks. Therefore, I cannot perform the lookup.

**Step 3: Search for Successful Logins**
The instruction is to check if the targeted account had any successful logins after.
*   The alert only specifies a *source* IP and doesn't identify specific accounts being targeted (unless derived from recent login attempts on prod-ssh-server, which aren't provided here). Without knowing which user accounts were specifically attempted or having access to system logs for that period, I cannot search for successful logins.

**Step 4: Recommend Remediation**
Based on the findings so far:
*   The alert indicates activity originating from an internal IP and targeting a specific SSH server.
    *   Since it's an **`internal-pc01`**, this could suggest a misconfigured system or potential insider threat. Resetting user passwords might be appropriate if access was suspected but unsuccessful on that machine, however the destination is different so we cannot tell if any accounts were compromised by these attempts alone.
    *   Blocking the **`source IP 10.1.1.12`** should only be considered after identifying which specific account(s) were targeted and confirming no successful login occurred from this source or others targeting those accounts, especially since it's an internal address.

**Recommendation:**
Due to incomplete information (no target account identification, inability to check logs/external databases), a definitive remediation action cannot be recommended. Security operations personnel should investigate the specific user accounts associated with `prod-ssh-server`, review system logs for that time frame and destination IPs around August 9th, 2025, and determine if any legitimate users were logged in or compromised based on their findings before taking further action like password resets or IP blocking.

Response to alert:
 timestamp: 2025-07-15 09:15:00
source_ip: 10.1.1.12
destination_ip: 192.168.1.101
source_port: 45211
destination_port: 22
source_hostname: internal-pc01
destination_hostname: prod-ssh-server
alert_type: Brute Force SSH
severity: high
rules_triggered: ['ssh_brute_force', 'multiple_failed_logins']
trigger_reason: More than 50 failed SSH login attempts in 5 minutes

Okay, let's handle the alert step by step:

**Step 1: Review Alert Details**
The alert involves a brute force SSH attack targeting `prod-ssh-server` (destination hostname) on port 22. The source is IP address `10.1.1.12`, identified as `internal-pc01`. The specific account targeted isn't provided, but the rule triggered indicates more than 50 failed attempts in a short period.

**Step 2: Check for Threat Intelligence**
I cannot perform live lookups of threat intelligence databases at this time.

**Step 3: Search for Successful Logins**
The alert does not specify which accounts were attempted. Therefore, I cannot search our authentication logs to determine if any specific account was successfully logged into following these failed attempts.

**Step 4: Recommend Remediation**
Based on the provided information (high number of failures over a short period), an attack is highly likely in progress or has recently occurred. However, without knowing which specific account was targeted or checking for signs of success, I cannot confirm if any accounts were compromised.

Recommendation: Block the source IP address `10.1.1.12` at the network perimeter (firewall) to prevent further brute force attempts against SSH services. Also, reset user passwords associated with the affected account(s). Further investigation into potential successful logins is recommended after blocking the IP and resetting credentials.
